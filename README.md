    - Handling and processing multiple input formats (text, audio, video) seamlessly.  
    - Achieving high transcription accuracy from varied audio/video sources.  
    - Generating summaries that preserve context and key information.  
    - Optimizing performance for fast, real-time responses using Groq.  
    - Connecting backend with Summarization models through Flask APIs. 
- Brainstorms: 
    - Learning to build news summarization model using Groq.
    - Figuring out way to connect it with NodeJs Backend.
    - Exploring various designs for frontend designing.
    - Transcribing news from video and audio inputs to text.
