      "you are welcome, my friend. It's sad, but 45 percent of children that live in to cacao\n",

      "a completely different problem. Believe it or not, America\n",
      "produces so much food, that almost 40 percent of\n",
      "it simply gets thrown away. But if we can preserve\n",
      "just ten percent of it, we could theoretically end\n",
      "hunger in the United States. And that brings us to the Philadelphia\n",
      "Wholesale Produce market... One of the largest food\n",
      "marketplaces in America! Where every year, up to ten million pounds of unsold\n",
      "food is at risk of going to waste. Which is where Evan and his\n",

      "not give it to people who are starving?\" That's right. It's a no-brainer. So Evan and his\n",
      "organization, Sharing Excess, collect millions of pounds of food that, for silly reasons, would\n",
      "have been thrown away. What are we lookin' for? This looks good. That looks good, so we're\n",

      "this is what you do with your pepper. Wait. Your pepper's deformed, Nolan. It's, like, curly. Yo, the boys wish they\n",
      "had a pepper this big. All this food is just what's been\n",
      "donated today from this building. And there's even more out there. We need more trucks to be able to pick up all of the food that's actually available. This market and others like it, have so much food that even Sharing Excess Organization can't distribute it all\n",
      "before it goes bad. But with just one more truck, they could rescue up to seven million\n",
      "pounds of additional food, every year. And maybe you can see where this is going, but I made sure Evan couldn't as I led him to the surprise\n",
      "that I had prepared for him. Evan, take off your\n",
      "blindfold and turn around! Look at your brand new truck!!! Yeah! And again, just by watching this video, you're helping us give more\n",
      "money to Sharing Excess so that they can continue to fill this\n",
      "new truck with food for years to come. But let me show you what just one\n",
      "day with an additional truck can do... starting with supplying the\n",
      "Double Trellis Food kitchen where they cook gourmet\n",
      "meals for the needy every day. Everything you see here\n",
      "would have been thrown away, but now it is a gourmet meal going\n",
      "to someone in need. This is crazy. And while the meals we\n",
      "cooked fed 600 people, our one truck still had thousands\n",
      "of pounds of fresh produce to stock multiple community fridges, hand out directly to\n",
      "people on the streets, and even host our own\n",
      "food drive in North Carolina, where hundreds of people\n",

      "- Do you know his name? No. She took a picture of me! Hey, neither do we! And once the food drive was over, I\n",
      "still had two more surprises for Evan. Evan, I have two checks for you. First, to get us to a million meals, here's a check for six\n",
